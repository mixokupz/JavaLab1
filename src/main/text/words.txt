Britain’s flag has always stood for Justice
Britain’s hope has always been for Peace
Britain’s foes have known that they could trust us
To do our best to make the cannons cease
Britain’s blood will never stand for insult
Britain’s sons will rally at her call
Britain’s pride will never let her exult
But we’ll never let the old flag fall
Chorus
We’ll never let the old flag fall
For we love it the best of all
We don’t want to fight to show our might
But when we start, we’ll fight, fight, fight
In peace or war you’ll hear us sing
God save the flag, God save the King
At the ends of the world, the flag’s unfurl’d
We’ll never let the old flag fall

Britain’s sons have always call’d her Mother
Britain’s sons have always lov’d her best
Britain’s sons would die to show they love her
The dear old Flag, laid on each manly breast
Britain’s ships have always rul’d the ocean
Britain’s sons will serve her one and all
Britain’s sons will show their true devotion
And we’ll never let the old flag fall
